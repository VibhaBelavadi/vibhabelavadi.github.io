Academic Projects:
======
-	Privacy Preservation of Sensitive Attributes (Spring’ 18): 
Successfully generated adversarial examples to misclassify standard state of the art Deep Learning Models for multiple sensitive attributes such as age, gender etc. for social good. Used TensorFlow, Keras and Python
- Differential Privacy Based Access Control System (Summer ’17): 
Implemented differential privacy based access control for a use case system of a large size company. Provided full and partial disclosure of confidential data based on the job requirement.
- Wink and Silence Expression Detection (Spring ’17):
Programmed/trained OpenCV to detect ‘shh expression’ (silence) and a ‘wink expression’ in images and live video using HAAR cascade classifiers. Achieved 85%+ accuracy.
- Adversarial Sample analysis in TensorFlow (Spring’ 17): 
Generated adversarial samples in Tensorflow using Fast Gradient Search Method. Project helped in building a security framework that would help mitigate the damage caused by adversarial sampling to highly sensitive inputs by doing statistical analysis of the said samples with respect to real input variable.
- Differential Privacy implementation in Java (Spring’ 17): 
Implemented in Java a differential privacy system using Laplace Mechanism and generated k-anonymized dataset as a part of Coursework for Data Applications and Security.
- WishaDish (Fall’ 16): 
As a part of HackAI, built an app to recommend a dish using Answer Set programming and s(ASP). For the starting point, the user social network (facebook) data was fed into the system and the results were further refined.
- Web Search Engine for food (Fall’ 16): 
Designed/developed topic based web search engine using Apache Nutch (web crawling), Apache Solr (indexing), Apache Lucene (page rank and HITS), query expansion; clustered the search results.
- Probabilistic graphical modeling (Spring’ 16):
Coded using MATLAB: MCMC sampling, Bethe Free energy approximation, Loopy Belief Propagation, Approximate MAP inference, Gibbs Sampling, MLE and Bayesian Structure Learning.
- Data Modeling & Analytics (Fall’ 15):
Implemented Monte Carlo Simulations, US Elections forecast, data modeling, Bootstrap library, hypothesis acceptance and rejection, regression fitting and diagnostics using R, R Studio.
- Cloud IAAS middleware (Fall’ 15): 
Designed a Cloud IAAS middleware with interface for job submission and scaling. Used libvirt for VM creation, scaling and migration. Employed Ganglia, shell scripting and RRD Tools for VM resource monitoring and graph generation. Tested using real time benchmark programs like Hadoop Mapreduce, YCSB, Darwin.
- IMDB Analytics and Movie Recommendation System (Spring’ 15):
Implemented map reduce design patterns to derive statistics (movies, users, ratings) and designed a movie recommendation system; Used Mahout and Hadoop/HDFS.
- Implementation & Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms (Fall’ 14):
Implemented in Java k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Regression, Collaborative Filtering, ID3 decision tree, Perceptron, and analyzed their accuracy using sample data. Performed error analysis on supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using WEKA.
